# Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Diagnostics Tests and Costs

Information from [© 1996 Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington. All rights reserved. Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Primary Prevention Guideline](https://wa.kaiserpermanente.org/static/pdf/public/guidelines/ascvd-primary.pdf)

## Definitions

**ASCVD, or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,** is caused by plaque buildup in arterial walls and refers to the following conditions:
* Coronary heart disease (CHD), such as myocardial infarction, angina, and coronary artery stenosis > 50%.
* Cerebrovascular disease, such as transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, and carotid artery stenosis > 50%.
* Peripheral artery disease, such as claudication.
* Aortic atherosclerotic disease, such as abdominal aortic aneurysm and descending thoracic aneurysm. Patients with incidental aortic atherosclerosis should follow usual care recommendations for ASCVD prevention (e.g., lifestyle changes, statins).

**Primary prevention** refers to the effort to prevent or delay the onset of ASCVD. \
**Secondary prevention** refers to the effort to treat known, clinically significant ASCVD, and to prevent or delay the onset of disease manifestations.

## Tests for ASCVD and Approximate Costs 

### Lipid Panel: for most patients
* Results from **lipid panel** - total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides
* Recommended that patient is non-fasting
* Patients with triglyceride levels > 400mg/dL will need to redo the lipid panel bust fasted.
* **Cost: $89.25 CAD** (from [Dynacare - lipid-profile](https://bloodtestscanada.com/products/lipid-profile))
* Takes ~ 1 business day
  * [Dynacare offers a full Cardiovascular Risk Profile Blood Test](https://bloodtestscanada.com/collections/cholesterol-lipid-blood-tests/products/cardiovascular-risk-profile) that **costs $399.25 CAD**
  * This tests: Cholesterol, Triglycerides, HDL, LDL, Apo A, Apo B, hsCRP, Lp-PLA2
  * Takes ~ 2 business days
* Consider re-screening intervals based on ASCVD risk:
  *   Every 5 yearsif  ASCVD risk < 7.5% over 10 years
  *   Every 2 years if ASCVD risk 7.5–14.9% over 10 years
  *   Annually if ASCVD risk ≥ 15% over 10 yearsand not on statin

### high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) Test: consider for patients at 7.5-14.9% risk
* For patients **at 7.5–14.9% ASCVD risk over 10 years,** consider testing with hs-CRP to help confirm elevated risk when deciding whether to recommend statin therapy
* **Cost: $99.25 CAD** (from [Dynacare - crp-hs](https://bloodtestscanada.com/products/crp-hs))

### Coronary artery calcium scoring: consider for patients at indeterminate risk or at intermediate risk and undecided about statins
* Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is not routinely recommended. However, CAC may be helpful for patients at intermediate ASCVD risk who are uncertain about taking a statin, and/or patients whose calculated risk is higher or lower than expected
* **Cost for a CT Scan in Ontario on average is $876 CAD,** based on a comparison from [New Choice Health](https://www.newchoicehealth.com/places/oregon/ontario/ct-scan)

### Biomarker tests: not recommended
Testing for the following biomarkers of inflammation and lipid-related markers is not recommended. Although they may be independently associated with cardiovascular disease risk, they have only a minimal prognostic value when added to conventional risk markers:
* Fibrinogen **(Cost: $99.25 CAD** from [Dynacare - fibrinogen](https://bloodtestscanada.com/products/fibrinogen))
* Lipoprotein(a) **(Cost: $89.25 CAD** from [Dynacare - lipoprotein-a](https://bloodtestscanada.com/products/lipoprotein-a))
* Phospholipase A2 (This would be tested in the [full Cardiovascular Risk Profile Blood Test offered by Dynacare](https://bloodtestscanada.com/collections/cholesterol-lipid-blood-tests/products/cardiovascular-risk-profile))
* Apolipoprotein B and A-1 combined **(Cost: $99.25 CAD** each from [Dynacare - apolipoprotein-b](https://bloodtestscanada.com/products/apolipoprotein-b) and [Dynacare - apolipoprotein-a](https://bloodtestscanada.com/products/apolipoprotein-a1))

### Full Caridac Tests
* [Dynacare offers a full Cardiovascular Risk Profile Blood Test](https://bloodtestscanada.com/collections/cholesterol-lipid-blood-tests/products/cardiovascular-risk-profile) that **costs $399.25 CAD**
  * This tests: Cholesterol, Triglycerides, HDL, LDL, Apo A, Apo B, hsCRP, Lp-PLA2
* [LifeLabs offers a Protein Unstable Lesion Signature Test (PLUS) Caridiac Test](https://www.lifelabs.com/test/puls-protein-unstable-lesion-signature-test/?myProvince=on) that **costs $350 CAD**
  * Measures the traces of proteins that leak from cardiac lesions in the blood vessel walls


# Costs for Gut Microbiome Sequencing

## Stool Collection Kit
* Cost: $12.75 USD [EasySampler® Stool Collection Kit from Alpco](https://www.alpco.com/store/easysamplerr-stool-collection-kit.html)
